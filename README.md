# Description of the contents within the main branch:

The main branch contains the primary development line of the project, serving as the central repository for the latest stable codebase. It encompasses the culmination of ongoing efforts, incorporating features, fixes, and enhancements that have undergone thorough review and validation. This branch reflects the most current and reliable version of the software, ensuring continuity and stability across the development process.

## Task1 (3x+1):

1-Creating PHP a program to calculate the mathematical function 3x + 1
2-testing the program with a single number and print all the values, find max  value (Highest number)  and count of iterations (Total stopping time).
3-Creating 2 function(ziad.php ,and functions,php) for calculating functions values (max value and count of iterations) of numbers range (e.g., 10 to 10^6). 
4-The HTML Forms (ziad.php)  created and prompted for range values (start and finish). As results store in array: numbers , maximum (highest) values and the number of iterations of them.
5-By the second function (functions.php) it finds the numbers with have max and min iterations and by the first function (ziad.php) it prints    number, count of iterration and highest values.
transform all of this into answering small example 

## Task2 (OOP, Access Modifiers, $this)

1-transforming the  first task to OOP.
2-Making the class part move to separate file.

## Task3 (Inheritance, UML):

1-Creating a child class (inheritance) based on the class of the previos task (3x+1) by adding new method wich can calculate statistics (histogram ) of function  3x+1 iteration values  from interval using the same two function (ziad.php and functions.php) .
2-Setting  correct variable modifiers (public, private...);
